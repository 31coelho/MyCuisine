This is a personal project based on a app that locates and searches restaurants around you. You can have a custom list of restaurants you most like and search restaurants by their name or city.

## Technology

It's based on Swift and SwiftUI, only available to iOS platforms. It uses Geoapify API's to get info about restaurants near user's location.

### This project is only being worked on to upgrade my skills and naturality on coding on Swift and using SwiftUI.
